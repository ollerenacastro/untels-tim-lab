main.py — Entry point for feed-orchestrator service.

Startup sequence (D-06):
  1. Build Redis and pycti clients
  2. Instantiate all 5 feed objects
  3. Run all feeds immediately (synchronously, before scheduler starts)
  4. Build and start the APScheduler background scheduler
  5. Block the main thread via uvicorn.run() (serves HTTP on port 8001)

APScheduler threads are daemon threads and continue running while uvicorn
